    "# EAS4940 Final Project - Predicting Surging Glaciers in Svalbard\n",
    "\n",
    "Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that flow under their own weight across the earth they sit on, like a big pool of syrup spreading out on a pancake. A particular type of glacier, called a “surging” glacier, experience cyclic velocity changes. They may flow slowly for year or decades before suddenly accelerating to speeds as fast as 4-5 meters per day over a short time period of weeks to months, before returning to their slow flow speeds. These surges can lead to a sudden spike in ice mass loss and can also be extremely hazardous. For example, the Himalayas, surging glaciers can breach ice dams, causing glacier lake outburst floods which can be catastrophic for people and infrastructure downstream. You can see an example of surging glacier from Alaska in this timelapse video from the National Parks Service in Alaska: https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=F1010B88-4C85-4EBB-949E-582D2E498372. \n",

    "Glaciers surges are challenging to predict. In fact, even determining if a given glacier is likely to surge, let alone when and why a surge will occur, can be difficult. In this project, you will use a series of glacier features to try to predict which glaciers may be prone to surges. The dataset you will use was prepared and published as part of the following paper:\n",
