They lead to more ice sheet mass loss and sea level rise by preventing snow from absorbing meltwater and enhancing meltwater runoff. Therefore, we are very interested in understanding where these ice slabs are located and how fast they are growing. Unfortunately, they are challenging to map since they are buried beneath the surface and we only have limited data about their extent from some airborne radar flight lines. Over the next two problem sets, we will work on predicting the location of ice slabs using remote sensing and climate model data. In this problem set, you will start by preparing the dataset for machine learning.   \n","\n","### Data Set Variables:    \n","**X** - x coordinate of data point (EPSG 3413)       \n","**Y** - y coordinate of data point (EPSG 3413)         \n","**IceSlab** - binary variable indicating if an ice slab was observed at a given location, 0 = no ice slab, 1 = ice slab observed            \n","**HV** - horizonal-vertical polarized backscatter from the Sentinel-1 SAR satellite in digital number space        \n","**SAR_melt** - non-dimensional estimate of firn/snow water content, lower values indicate more stored melt           \n","**MAR** - decadal average melt to accumulation (snowfall) ratio from a regional climate model         \n","**RACMO_melt** - decadal average surface melt from the regional climate model RACMO in mm of water equivalent per year           \n","**RACMO_snow** - decadal average snowfall rate from the regional climate model RACMO in mm of water equivalent per year          \n","**MAT** - mean annual temperature in degrees Celcius from the regional climate model MAR           \n","**Xpol** - cross polarized backscater ratio from the Sentinel-1 SAR satellite in digital number space             \n","**Elevation** - surface elevation in meters           "],"metadata":{"id":"CO8CSr1PQOjZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(1) In the code block below, import your packages."],"metadata":{"id":"6Z-7NP_eSjhC"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eRJmiCsm8Fi0"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(2) Load the from the course github at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtculberg/ml_in_eas/main/IceSlabs.csv.
