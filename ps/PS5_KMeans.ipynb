Each column in the dataframe (e.g. each of the 29 features) represents the velocity at that location at a particular time. For example, t1 corresponds to 23 Jan 2019 and t29 is 18 Dec 2019. Therefore each row of the dataframe is a time series of ice velocity from Jan-Dec 2019 at a particular location on the ice sheet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this problem set is to find clusters of common seasonal velocity patterns, e.g. velocity time series from different locations on the ice sheet that behave similarly. For example, all locations that have slow spring velocities, speed up during the summer, and return to slow velocities in the winter might constitute a cluster. Glaciologists are interested in these patterns because they can shed light on interactions between ice velocity and surface melting. For example, previous work has identified a common pattern where some glaciers speed up when surface meltwater runoff is high, and slow down when it is low due to additional basal lubrication that allows the ice to slide faster."

Since we want to cluster time series with common patterns, it makes more sense to rescale the each time series by its own min and max, rather than scaling all velocities at a given point in time based on the min and max velocities across the whole ice sheet.
