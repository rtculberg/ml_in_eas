So for example, if the average temperature on day 1 was 5 C and on day 2 was 2 C, then the positive degree day (PDD) value for those two days would be 7. By calibrating this relationship, we can estimate total snowmelt without needing to run a complicated physical model.   \n","\n","### Data Features   \n","**pdd** - positive degree days in degrees Celcius          \n","**melt** - monthly melt rate in mm of water equivalent per month\n","\n","We will use the [PyMC3](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html) package for Bayesian Linear Regression.
